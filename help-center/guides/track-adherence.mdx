## Overview

Adherence tracking is a powerful feature that helps coaches monitor how well clients are following their assigned diet plans. You can view adherence percentages, identify clients who need support, and track trends over time.

Adherence is calculated by comparing what clients actually log against what's assigned in their diet plans.

## Understanding Adherence

**What is Adherence?**
- Adherence measures how closely clients follow their assigned diet plans
- Calculated as a percentage (0-100%)
- Based on food items logged vs. food items assigned
- Updated in real-time as clients log meals

**Adherence Levels:**
- **90-100%**: Excellent adherence
- **70-89%**: Good adherence
- **50-69%**: Needs improvement
- **Below 50%**: Requires attention
